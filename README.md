# Tesla_stock_prediction_model
This project focuses on time series forecasting of Tesla (TSLA) stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM models are well-suited for sequential data and are capable of learning long-term dependencies, making them effective for financial time series prediction.
